new_requisition,"Subject: Quick question re: recruitment services
Hi there,
Lauren here from Tidemark Publishing. We're a small independent publisher in Portland, around 30 people, mostly doing regional interest books and some educational materials.
So here's the situation – our Marketing Director just told us she's pregnant and will be going on maternity leave starting in April. Congrats to her obviously, but it leaves us in a bit of a bind because we've got our biggest book launch of the year happening in May and we absolutely cannot drop the ball on publicity.
We need someone who can step in on a contract basis, maybe 6-8 months, who actually understands book marketing and isn't going to suggest we go viral on TikTok or whatever. Someone with traditional media contacts, experience organizing author events, that kind of thing.
I found your agency through a Google search and your website looked reasonably credible. What's your process like and how quickly could you turn around some candidates? Also what do you charge for contract placements?
Sorry for the somewhat chaotic email – it's been one of those weeks!

Hey guys,

I am in a bit of a bind here. My Site Manager for the downtown high-rise project walked off the job this morning without notice. I need a replacement yesterday.

I need someone who knows commercial construction inside out. They need to be able to read blueprints, manage subcontractors, and handle safety inspections. Five to seven years of experience is fine, as long as they are tough and can keep the crew in line.

I do not have time to write a full job description. Just find me someone who has managed multi-million dollar projects and is available to start immediately. I will clear my schedule for interviews tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks,

Jim Kowalski Director of Operations IronClad Construction"

Hi,
Streamline Software needs a senior DevOps engineer who really knows their stuff, specifically around Kubernetes and container orchestration.
Here's the deal - we're migrating our entire infrastructure from VMs to containerized microservices and it's more complex than we anticipated. We need someone who's done this before and can lead the technical implementation.
Must haves:

6+ years DevOps/Infrastructure experience
Deep Kubernetes knowledge (we're talking production experience managing K8s clusters at scale, not just tutorials)
Strong with Terraform, Ansible, or similar IaC tools
CI/CD pipeline expertise (Jenkins, GitLab CI, ArgoCD, etc.)
Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack)
Security best practices for containerized environments
Scripting skills (Python, Bash, Go)

Nice to haves:

Service mesh experience (Istio, Linkerd)
Multi-cloud experience (we use both AWS and GCP)
Experience with Helm charts

What they'll actually be doing:

Leading our container migration project
Designing and implementing our K8s infrastructure
Setting up monitoring, logging, alerting for the new environment
Working with development teams on containerization strategies
Establishing best practices and documentation
On-call rotation (1 week per month)

We're a 80-person software company making workflow automation tools for healthcare. Fast-paced environment, lots of interesting technical challenges. Team is smart and collaborative.
Remote work is fine but we have a slight preference for someone who can come to our Seattle office occasionally (once a month or so). Salary range 130-155k plus equity and full benefits.
Timeline is flexible but sooner is better. This is a key role for us right now.

new_requisition,"looking for a rockstar ui/ux designer!

Hey team!

Hope you are all doing awesome.

We just closed our Series A funding (yay!) and Sprout Social App is officially growing up. We need a killer UI/UX Designer to join the squad and totally revamp our mobile interface. The current design is a bit clunky and we need that sleek, modern, Gen-Z appeal.

We are looking for a creative soul with 3-5 years of experience in mobile app design. Figma wizardry is a must. They should have a portfolio that screams color and bold typography. If they have done animation work, that is a huge bonus.

We are a remote-first company, super chill vibes, unlimited PTO, and we do annual retreats. We want someone who is fun to work with, maybe a bit quirky, and passionate about social connectivity.

Can you find us some portfolios to look at? We do not care about degrees, just raw talent.

Cheers,

Hey Simone!
Quick one – we're absolutely slammed here at Cactus Media Group and need to bring on 2 Digital Marketing Specialists and possibly a Content Lead if we find the right person. We're a creative agency in Austin, about 65 people, mostly working on campaigns for consumer brands in the food and beverage space.

Hey Ritu,

Hope this email finds you well!

We really enjoyed speaking with you last week about the UI Developer role, and the team was impressed with your technical skills and portfolio work. We'd love to have you back for a second round!

This time it'll be a bit more technical - you'll be meeting with Arpit (our Frontend Lead) and doing a live coding challenge. Nothing too scary, just want to see how you approach problems in real-time. The whole thing should take about an hour, maybe a bit more.

We're looking at Thursday, Dec 19th around 11am. Does that work for you? We'll do it over Zoom again.

Also, heads up - Arpit will share a Codepen link at the start, so just make sure you have access to that. No need to prepare anything specific, just be ready to write some HTML/CSS/JS!

Let me know if Thursday works or if we need to find another time.

Hi David,

I hope you are having a wonderful week!

I am so excited to share that we finally received the Trillium grant we applied for last year. This means we have the funding secured to hire a full-time Program Coordinator for our after-school arts initiative.

We are looking for someone with a background in youth work and perhaps some experience with grant reporting, though that is teachable. The most important thing is that they have high energy and are great with teenagers.

Our budget is a bit tight, around 55k CAD, but we offer great benefits and a really supportive work environment.

Could you let me know what the timeline usually looks like for a search like this? We are hoping to have someone in place before the summer camps start in June.

This is Priya from Cornerstone Beverages in Christchurch. We're a drinks distributor – craft beers, wines, some specialty sodas – and we've got about 140 staff between our warehouse, drivers, and sales team.
Right so we've been trying to hire a Warehouse Supervisor for literally three months now and it's just not happening. We've had two people accept offers and then bail before their start date, and the candidates we're seeing through regular job ads are frankly not suitable. One guy turned up to the interview in jandals which probably tells you something.

I know you folks at Coastal Recruitment have done warehouse placements before – saw your case study on the website. Can you take this on? We're genuinely desperate at this point and willing to pay a premium if you can find us someone decent who'll actually show up.

Hi Team,

We are looking for a mid-level Graphic Designer to join our marketing squad. We are a fully remote company, so they can be based anywhere, but they need to overlap with EST hours for at least 4 hours a day.

We need someone who is a wizard with Adobe Creative Suite and has a great eye for typography. They will be designing social media assets, slide decks, and occasional print materials for our events. We do not want a corporate robot. We want someone with a funky portfolio who understands youth culture and trends.
